This is a program to visualize 6 common sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.

The GUI is created using Python module Tkinter. The program takes the max and min size of the array from the user and generates a random list of 100 numbers within the specified range and allows the user to choose the type of sorting algorithm they want to visualize.
